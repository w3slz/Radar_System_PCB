# Simple Doppler Radar Design (Ongoing)

## Description
Improve upon existing doppler radar system design from Quarter 1 and compete with other groups using improved radar system.  Design a competitive radar system by placing emphasis on low power consumption, low weight, and accuracy.

## Procedure
1)	Examine Quarter 1 design and note areas for improvement

	a.	Use surface mount RF components to reduce weight

	b.	Use patch antenna for higher gain and reduced weight

2)	Design the PCB layout
3)	Assemble  and test the new design 
4)	Make any adjustments to further optimize radar system design
